This is an R Markdown document. 
For HW, we strongly recommend you "Knit" to PDF (not Word, not HTML).

The following is just a template.   
It's not related to any specific HW assignment

# Q1
This is question 1,

## Q1a
which has a part (a)

## Q1b
then part (b)

## Q1c
and finally part (c)

# Q2
the next question is 2.

## Q2a
It only has a part (a)

## Q2b
and a part (b).

# Q3

Now, I'm just going to do a bunch of stuff in R Markdown that you
can use for ideas for formatting your work.

## Q3a
Some of this I borrowed from the R Markdown (by RStudio) tutorial:   
[http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html).

## Q3b
End a line with two spaces  
to start a new line. Plus, these two -- words are separated by a long dash.

Here is the start of the next paragraph where
**this text is bold,** whereas *this text is in italics*.
You can even ~~strikethrough text~~, although I can't think why you would need to.

> A long quote starts with a greater than sign and gets indented on both sides.  Well, only until you hit return to start a new line.  I think I'll just repeat that to demonstrate a long quote.  A long quote starts with a greater than sign and gets indented on both sides.  Well, only until you hit return to start a new line.

Finally, the quote is finished!

# Q4

## Q4a
Here is an **itemized list**.
Leave a blank line before the list.
Indent using at least 4 spaces.

* item 1
* item 2
    + sub-item 1
    + sub-item 2
* item 3
    + sub-item 1
    
## Q4b

Here is an **ordered list**.
Leave a blank line before the list.
Indent using at least 4 spaces.

1. item 1
2. item 2
    a. sub-item 1
    a. sub-item 2
5. item 3
    a. sub-item 1
    
## Table

Table Header  | Second Header
------------- | --------
Table Cell 1  | Cell 2
Cell 3        | Cell 4, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa


You can center, right-, or left-justify  text in your tables as you like.

**Knitted Output:**

Centered | Right-Justified | Left-Justified
:-------:|----------------:|:----------------
A        | 24              |  My Friend's Name
B        |  5              |  My Name
CC       | 167             |  Firstname Lastname
DDD      | 48              |  Another Name
